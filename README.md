# simpleBackLinker
A really simple Python script to create backlinks in an Obsidian Vault

This is just a simple backlinking script I use in my Obsidian maintenance. I created it and then improved it with help from ChatGPT. 

Since I name every note (using templates) with YYYY-MM-DD as a prefix, this script runs on my Mac and creates backlinks inside each daily note to include any notes created each day.
